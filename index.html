		<p><img src="images/smiley.jpg" alt="Smiley face" style="float:right;width:42px;height:42px;"> This 9 point checklist is primarily focused on getting some basic "off-page" <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr> in place and will help you get some natural and easy to acquire backlinks to your website to get your <abbr title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</abbr> journey started.</p>

		<p><b><i><a href="#c1" class="j">Jump to Guest Blogging</a></b></i></p>
		<p><b><i><a href="#c2" class="j">Jump to Forum Discussion</a></b></i></p>

		<p>Whilst most of these strategies won't help you acquire droves of non stop high quality links (if only it were that simple) they will help you get the basics in place so other webmasters are more likely to link to you and help you get some simple backlinks to get the ball rolling.</p>

		<p class="pcolor bc">Remember, when a popular website links to your content, Google considers this as a vote of confidence from a trusted source.</p>

		<p class="pcolor">The more authority links you have for a piece of content, the higher your rankings will get.</p>

		<pre>So you want to gain as many high quality backlinks (quality over just quantity)<br> as possible and this guide will give you<br> the basic foundations to achieve that.</pre>

		<p>However, there are a few things<br>that you need to keep in mind<br>in order to naturally pick up easy backlinks.</p>

		<hr>

		<image src="images/seo_tips.jpg" alt="seotips">

		<hr>	

		<p>Here’s a quick look at 9 of them...</p>

		<h2>1) Use Natural Anchor Text</h2>

			<p>Anchor text is the text used when another website is linking to you (E.g. If I write "I am linking to NicheHacks here" then the anchor text is "I am linking to NicheHacks here").</p>

			<p>So, if you're EARNING backlinks naturally (and for the most part you should be) then this is a <b>non issue as the webmasters linking to you will dictate what anchor text they use in their links.</b></p>

			<p>However, <strong>if you're "building" some backlinks through guest posting, blog commenting, forums and web 2.0 / social sites</strong> (which i do not recommend) then take this into consideration...</p>

			<p>Google has come down hard on irrelevant and unnatural backlinks in the last few years.</p>

			<p>In simple words, if you’re consistently creating links with exact keyword anchors, you’ll get into trouble with Google.

			<i>The right way is to create anchors that fit naturally with the overall the overall content on a page.</i>

			When creating backlinks, use anchor phrases instead of anchor words.

			<em>Include your main keyword and its variations in your anchor phrase.</em>

			Or better still just be completely natural and build your links around natural phrases and text instead of keywords you're trying to rank for.

			Again, if your backlinking activities are all natural and come from earning links from other websites then you don't have to worry at all about this as it will be varied and you have no control over it anyway.</p>

			<p class="pcolor">I would recommend you avoid "building" links and earn them naturally.</p>

		<h2>2) Create Link-worthy and Share-worthy Content</h2>

		<p>The key to getting natural, relevant and high authority backlinks is to create content that people love sharing.

Research shows that certain types of content are shared more frequently than others.

<b><i>Focus on the content types that are shared more frequently.</b></i>

Notice how infographics are the most frequently shared content type.

<mark>This is because people like quoting and sharing data backed content.</mark>

Including data references in your content can get you powerful backlinks from authority sites.</p>

		<h2>3) Influencer Outreach</h2>

		<p>Building relationships with the influencers in your niche is the key to getting easy and high authority backlinks.</p>

<p id="txt-1">No wonder it is one of the fastest growing methods for customer acquisition.</p>

<p>Work on maintaining a good relationship with the experts in your industry, and reach out to them from time to time <small>when you publish new and relevant content.</small></p>

		<h2 id="c1">4) Guest Blogging</h2>

		<p>If you do it the right way, guest blogging is one of the best ways to get backlinks from authority websites in your niche.</p>

<p><del>What is the right way?</del></p>

<p>Simple, <ins>only guest blog on high quality, relevant, websites in your niche</ins> where your target audience already hang out and you'd be proud to be featured on.</p>

<p>Avoid any <sub>spammy</sub> or <sup>dubious websites</sup> especially ones that allow anyone to guest post or ask for payment to allow you to publish your post.</p>

		<h2>5) Blog Commenting</h2>

		<p>Believe it or not, blog commenting still works.But not the way you think.</p>

<p>You can’t build backlinks with blog commenting because most of the times they’re “no-follow” links with little SEO value.</p>

<p>But you can use them to build relationships and create long-term partnerships that can help you achieve bigger SEO goals like being featured in expert roundup posts, being cited as an expert and getting more natural backlinks to your site.</p>

		<h2 id="c2">6) Forum Discussions</h2>

		<p>Just like blog commenting, niche specific forums are some of the best places to build relationships in your industry and get cited on other authority blogs as an expert.</p>

<p>There are hundreds of forums in every niche.</p>

<p>You just need to find them using different search queries on Google.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
	<li>“your primary keyword + forums”</li>

	<li>“industry + forums”</li>

	<li>“industry/keyword + discussion”</li>
</ul>

		<h2>7) Claim Your Business Profiles on the Web</h2>

		<p>You don’t want some unknown weirdo to show up in search results when your brand name is searched on Google, right?</p>

<p>It’s not just about your reputation either.</p>

<p>Branding is a core part of Google’s search algorithms.</p>

<p>Stronger and well-known brands are not only preferred in search results but are also unlikely to get a Google penalty (unless they commit a strong offense).</p>

<p>Claiming your brand name on all the major platforms on the web is one of the easiest ways to create a strong brand image in Google’s eyes.</p>

<p>It also gives you a shortcut to Google’s first page whenever someone looks specifically for you.</p>

<p>For example, look at the top results when I searched for Digital Marketer (a well-known brand in the digital marketing space)</p>

<p>Here are some of the websites/platforms where you can create your business profiles with your exact brand name, and link back to your website’s homepage (if the platforms are relevant to your business type or niche).</p>

<ol type="A">
	<li>Twitter</li>
	<li>Facebook</li>
	<li>Google+</li>
	<li>Yelp</li>
	<li>Crunchbase</li>
	<li>Youtube</li>
	<li>Linkedin.com</li>
	<li>Tumblr</li>
	<li>Pinterest</li>
	<li>StumbleUpon</li>
	<li>Etsy</li>
	<li>Gravatar</li>
	<li>Scribd</li>
	<li>LiveJournal</li>
	<li>HubPages</li>
	<li>Flickr</li>
	<li>PhotoBucket</li>
</ol>
 

<p>Make sure you always use your brand name when creating profiles for your blog even on other websites.
</p>

		<h2>8) Create Social Media Profiles to Boost Rankings</h2>

		<p>Cognitive SEO carried out an extensive study to understand the relationship between the social media presence of a brand and its search engine rankings.</p>

<p>The study found a direct relationship between higher rankings and a strong social media influence.</p>
<p>The least you could do to take advantage of this is to create your social media profiles on some of the major platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Google+, LinkedIn etc.</p>

<p>Link back to your site from your profiles and use them to share your content.</p>

		<h2>9) Enable Twitter Cards and Facebook Open Graph To Boost Engagement</h2>

		<p>Your social media influence is directly related to the level of engagement your social media posts generate.</p>

<p>Enabling Twitter Cards and Facebook Open Graph makes your posts on these platforms more engaging and help you generate more clicks.</p>

<p>For example, which of these tweets looks more attention grabbing?</p>


<p>The difference is clear.</p>

<p>The same happens when you enable Facebook Open Graph.</p>

<p>It shows additional details of your post, along with your featured image and a short description which helps people understand your post better.</p>

<p>Pinterest also has a similar feature called Rich Pins.</p>

		<h3>Now Check Your Way To Natural Backlinks</h3>

		<p>Whilst none of these 9 items will pick you up endless droves of new links (if only it were that easy) they allow you to get the basics in place to naturally pick up easy links.</p>

<p>And that's enough to get you started and get the ball rolling on picking up easy links without being tempted to go the "blackhat" route and start spamming your own website, buying link packages from Fiverr, or paying for links which are all against Googles rules and will likely harm you in the long term. </p>

<h3> Some SEO Quotes</h3>
<p><q>SEO Isn’t About Gaming the System Anymore; It’s About Learning How to Play by the Rules.</q> by Jordan Teicher</p>
<p><q>If You’re Going to Post Content on Your Site Anyway, You Might as Well Take the Time to Make Sure Google Takes Notice of Your Effort.</q> by the content Factory </p>
<p><blockquote>Good SEO Is Paying Attention to All the Details That Most Bloggers Ignore.</blockquote> by Ryan Biddulph</p>
<p><blockquote>If You Don’t Know the User Intent Behind the Keywords You’re Optimizing for Then You’re Doing It Wrong. Also, If You Are Optimizing for Keywords vs the Needs of the User Then You’re Doing It Wrong.</blockquote> by Jordan Kasteler</p>
